[Cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space. With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.

What's this new konnector?
--------------------------
This konnector collects your Enercoop bills.

### Add your new connector to [Cozy Collect](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect)

The Cozy Collect application will soon use an application store as source of connectors. But for
now, if you want to add your new connector to Cozy Collect, you can submit a message in the forum

you.
